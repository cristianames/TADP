#Set Up
To Set up your enviorment just go to the links below and follow the instructions 

Instalation:  http://tadp-utn-frba.github.io/guias/ruby/

Language guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9nNG82xynkPSq0L-ZiJqvDDsFo3qH33kOKxi_T5tvI/pub

#Execute
To execute the program just open a terminal and require the file 'pattern_matching.rb'. After that,  you can use all the features that the program provides to you.

#IRB
In order to run the program with irb, first make sure you already got irb installed on your computer, then just type irb to run the irb program

When the program starts, just make a require to the file you want to open, with the following sintax: require './relative_path.rb'

Once you've load some file you can always reload it using the load call like the require one.

You can use either the RubyMine console or the regular Linux console. In windows I think you have to use a specific program to run ruby, but once opened this program the rest should be the same.
